#so basically we are going see libraries
#1)numpy=which do operations on arrays
#2)pandas=this is going to give real test of data science 
#3)mat.lib=helpful for generating graphs

#numpy is library for python programming language where we got support of 
#large ,multidimensional arrays and matrices ,along with large collection of
